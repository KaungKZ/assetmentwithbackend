        question: 'What is Enriched Air Nitrox?',
        answer: (
          <div className="wrapper">
            <p>
              Enriched Air Nitrox is a type of breathing gas that has a higher
              oxygen content than air. Most Nitrox mixes contain anywhere from
              28% to 36% oxygen and only 64% to 72% nitrogen. This makes Nitrox
              a desired gas to dive with as there is a lesser build up of
              nitrogen in your body, allowing you to dive longer.

        answer: (
          <div className="wrapper">
            <p>
              Diving with Enriched Air Nitrox can provide longer bottom times,
              shorter surface intervals, and reduce fatigue during repetitive
              dives.

        answer: (
          <div className="wrapper">
            <p>
              No, Enriched Air Nitrox does not provide any significant safety
              advantage when diving deeper. In fact, diving with enriched air
              nitrox has specific depth limitations and considerations due to
              the higher oxygen content. It is primarily used to extend bottom
              time and reduce the risk of decompression sickness for
              recreational dives within certain depth limits.
