            <p>
              PADI Sidemount diving is a configuration where divers wear their
              tanks mounted on either side of their body, instead of on their
              back, which provides greater flexibility and comfort.

        answer: (
          <div className="wrapper">
            <p>
              The main benefits of PADI Sidemount diving include better buoyancy
              control, easier and safer tank access, and more streamlined
              equipment configuration. It also allows divers to carry more tanks
              for longer dives or decompression stops.

            <p>
              PADI Sidemount diving can be suitable for beginners who have
              completed the PADI Open Water Diver course or equivalent. However,
              it is recommended that divers gain experience with traditional
              back-mounted tanks before attempting Sidemount diving.

        answer: (
          <div className="wrapper">
            <p>
              Sidemount divers require special Sidemount harnesses, regulators,
              and tank mounting systems. However, Bermuda Diving Center provide
              full gear as part of the course fee. You may also need a dive

              PADI Sidemount diving can be used for a wide range of dives,
              including reef, wreck, and cave diving. It is particularly useful
              for technical dives that require longer bottom times or multiple
