              Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact
              with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world
              and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your

              information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with
              you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii)
              processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to
              which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that
              is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
              official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for
              the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a

              of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement,

            <p>
              Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
              websites you visit that you do not want to have your online
              activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting
              information in connection with a website. For these purposes,
              tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information
              from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as
              they move across different websites over time. The Website and
              Services do not track its visitors over time and across
              third-party websites. However, some third-party websites may keep
              track of your browsing activities when they serve you content,
              which enables them to tailor what they present to you.
