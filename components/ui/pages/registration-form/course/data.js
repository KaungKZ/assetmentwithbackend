          I, hereby affirm that I aware that skin and scuba diving have inherent
          risks which may result in serious injury or death. I understand that
          diving with compressed air involves certain inherent risks;
          decompression sickness, embolism or other hyperbaric injuries can
          occur that require treatment in a recompression chamber. I further
          understand that this program may be conducted at a site that is
          remote, either by time or distance or both, from such as recompression
          chamber. I still choose to proceed with this program in spite of the
          absence of a recompression chamber or medical facility in proximity to
          the dive site. The information I have provided about my medical
          history on the Medical Questionnaire is accurate to the best of my
          knowledge. I agree to accept responsibility for omissions regarding my
          failure to disclose any existing or past health conditions. I

          may occur as a result of my participation in this program or as a
          result of the negligence of the Released Parties, whether passive or

          program, I hereby personally assume all risks for any harm, injury or
          damage, whether foreseen or unforeseen, that may befall me while

          and the Released Parties from any claim or lawsuit by me, my family,
          estate, heirs or assigns, arising out of my participation in this
          program. I further understand that skin diving and scuba diving are
          physically strenuous activities and that I will be exerting myself
          during this program and that if I am injured as a result of heart
          attack, panic, hyperventilation, etc., that I expressly assume the
          risk of said injuries and that I will not hold the Released Parties
          responsible for the same. I further state that I am of lawful age and
